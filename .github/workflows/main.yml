  # Contributor README Automation
  # Runs on push to main branch only
  # Updates README.md with contributor avatars and links
  # Security: SHA-pinned action, minimal permissions (contents:write, pull-requests:write), no secrets used
  # No code execution from untrusted sources; safe for pull_request_target if needed (but uses push trigger)
