## 2025-07-15 - Multi-Tenant Authorization Bypass in LangGraph Routes

**Vulnerability:**
The LangGraph integrations (`/lgm/*` HTTP endpoints and their associated service functions in `packages/openmemory-js/src/ai/graph.ts`) were not performing any authentication/authorization checks to partition user scopes. Regular authenticated API keys could query and mutate LangGraph node memories belonging to other tenants entirely (or store data under arbitrary/forged `user_id` values), resulting in a full isolation bypass.

**Learning:**
This vulnerability existed because LangGraph routes did not apply `require_tenant` and `reject_tenant_mismatch` validation middleware, and the underlying database/vector retrieval queries inside `graph.ts` did not filter by a target `user_id`. This bypassed the standard tenant-partitioning pattern used elsewhere in the codebase.

**Prevention:**
Always enforce a standard "defense-in-depth" rule where *all* user-interactive endpoints call middleware that maps the request to an authenticated tenant scope, and pass that `user_id` down to every single database query, search, and list operation. Validate and reject any explicit payload-supplied `user_id` that disagrees with the authenticated key.
