# Allowlist for logger-spy checker
# Lines beginning with # are comments and ignored.
# Add relative file paths (tracked files) or prefix patterns ending with * to allow matches.

# Example: allow a specific legacy test file
# tests/backend/legacy-logger-fallback.test.ts

# Example: allow all files in a vendor dir (not recommended)
# vendor/some-legacy/*

# Add your allowlist entries below (one per line):
tests/backend/crypto.test.ts
