# DEPRECATED: moved to backend/bunfig.toml to align with test working-directory
# This file is intentionally left as a stub to avoid accidental pickup by
# older environments. The canonical bun configuration for the backend now
# lives at `backend/bunfig.toml`. Keep this file only to avoid accidental
# discovery by older Bun versions or tools that expect a root bunfig.

# See `backend/bunfig.toml` for the authoritative configuration used by
# CI and local development. Remove this stub when all developer tooling
# and CI pipelines have been updated to reference the backend bunfig.
