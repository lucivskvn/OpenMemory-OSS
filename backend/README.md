# Backend developer notes

See the developer transactions guide for recommended patterns when working with transactions in the backend codebase.

- Developer transactions guide: `TRANSACTIONS.md` (in this same folder)

This file is a lightweight pointer — the canonical guide with examples and the exported `withTransaction` helper lives in `backend/TRANSACTIONS.md`.
